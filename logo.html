  A logo design is a visual symbol that represents a brand, organization, or group. It combines typography, imagery, and colors to create a unique and recognizable identity. A well-designed logo should be simple, memorable, versatile, and relevant to its purpose.
</p>
<h4>
  Types of Logos:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wordmark (Logotype) – A text-based logo using custom typography (e.g., Coca-Cola).</li>
<li>Lettermark (Monogram) – Initial-based logos for simplicity (e.g., NASA).</li>
<li>Icon (Symbol or Emblem) – A graphical representation (e.g., Apple).</li>
<li>Combination Mark – A mix of text and symbol (e.g., Adidas).</li>
<li>Emblem – A traditional, badge-like design (e.g., Harley-Davidson).</li>

</ul>
<p>
  In your case, since you're designing a logo for a resistance group with a propaganda goal and a freedom theme, the design should emphasize strength, unity, and rebellion through bold shapes, powerful symbols (such as fists, wings, or flames), and a striking color scheme like red, black, or deep blue.
