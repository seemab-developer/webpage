    A poster is a visual communication tool used to convey a message, promote an event, or raise awareness about a cause. It combines images, typography, and colors in an eye-catching layout to attract attention and engage viewers.
</p>
<h4>
    Types of Posters:
</h4>

<ul>
<li>Promotional Posters – Used for advertising products, movies, or events.</li>
<li>Propaganda Posters – Designed to influence public opinion and inspire action.</li>
<li>Informational Posters – Used for educational or awareness campaigns.</li>
<li>Artistic Posters – Focused on creative expression and aesthetics.</li>

</ul>
<p>
    Since you’re working on a resistance group with a propaganda goal and a freedom theme, your poster should feature bold imagery, strong slogans, and symbolic elements like raised fists, broken chains, or silhouettes of revolutionaries. High-contrast colors like red, black, and white can evoke power and urgency.
